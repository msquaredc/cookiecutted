	This index.html file is to be used only if you do not want to use create-elm-app. If you're using create-elm-app, it's safe to delete this file!
	See the README (Usage > Alternatives to create-elm-app) for full instructions.

	Note that all other Elm dev servers I've tried still have some issues with `pushState` and 404 redirection when routing URLs with subpaths, and thus do not fully support SPAs.
	I would highly recommend using create-elm-app to avoid these potential issues, unless you are very familiar with SPAs.

	Again, if you use create-elm-app, you can safely delete this file.
